     If you have any question, you will defenetely find an answer here. But it might take a lot of time...
     
   - [*Stanford CS228 notes*](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/)

     Useful notes which covers a lot of math details of algorithms

2. **Structure learning**
   - [*He, C., Liu, W., & Ren, J. (2022, December). Bayesian Network Structure Learning: A Review. In 2022 6th Asian Conference on Artificial Intelligence Technology (ACAIT) (pp. 1-7). IEEE.*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10137915)

     The paprer contains general ideas of main methods. If you wanna learn more you will also find a lot of links
    
   - [*Kitson, N. K., Constantinou, A. C., Guo, Z., Liu, Y., & Chobtham, K. (2023). A survey of Bayesian Network structure learning. Artificial Intelligence Review, 1-94.*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-022-10351-w)

     Another survey but level hard

     That is a rather recent paper about an curious case

4. **Inference**
